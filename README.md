How do you create a pull request on GitHub to propose changes to an existing repository?

Creating the pull request
1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. In the "Branch" menu, choose the branch that contains your commits.
3. Above the list of files, in the yellow banner, click Compare & pull request to create a pull request for the associated branch.
4. Use the base branch dropdown menu to select the branch you'd like to merge your changes into, then use the compare branch drop-down menu to choose the topic branch you made your changes in.
5. Type a title and description for your pull request.
6. To create a pull request that is ready for review, click Create Pull Request. To create a draft pull request, use the drop-down and select Create Draft Pull Request, then click Draft Pull Request. If you are the member of an organization, you may need to request access to draft pull requests from an organization owner. See "About pull requests."
